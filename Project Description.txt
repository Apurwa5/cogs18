This project is on encryption and decryption of a given message. There are three functions , choice, message and translated. Choice gives a question asking whether the user wants to encrypt or decrypt. Then the message is entered. Depending on the answer given to the question in choice function, the translated function either goes through the if/else loop. If the answer is 'e'(encryption), it goes through the if statement. If the answer is 'd'(decryption) then it goes through else statement. In the end the function prints out either the decrypted or encrypted message.
